# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄

This project aims to predict customer churn in the banking sector using a machine learning approach. The model is trained on a dataset containing various customer attributes. The objective is to accurately classify customers as either likely to churn or not, allowing the bank to take proactive measures.
